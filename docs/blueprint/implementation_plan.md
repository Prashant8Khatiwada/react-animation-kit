# Animation Library - Architectural Blueprint

## Overview

Creating a comprehensive architectural blueprint for a production-ready, lightweight React/Next.js animation library built on Framer Motion. The library will support 100+ animations with SSR safety, tree-shaking, and exceptional developer experience.

## Deliverables

This blueprint is split into focused documents for clarity and maintainability:

1. **[architecture.md](file:///home/slayer/.gemini/antigravity/brain/7af9d691-5c43-4eab-8a96-b83546283baa/architecture.md)** - Core system architecture, build setup, and technical decisions
2. **[folder-structure.md](file:///home/slayer/.gemini/antigravity/brain/7af9d691-5c43-4eab-8a96-b83546283baa/folder-structure.md)** - Complete file organization and naming conventions
3. **[api-patterns.md](file:///home/slayer/.gemini/antigravity/brain/7af9d691-5c43-4eab-8a96-b83546283baa/api-patterns.md)** - Component APIs, variant strategy, and usage patterns
4. **[design-guidelines.md](file:///home/slayer/.gemini/antigravity/brain/7af9d691-5c43-4eab-8a96-b83546283baa/design-guidelines.md)** - Animation identity, motion principles, and design rules
5. **[animation-catalog.md](file:///home/slayer/.gemini/antigravity/brain/7af9d691-5c43-4eab-8a96-b83546283baa/animation-catalog.md)** - Complete list of planned animations by category
6. **[documentation-plan.md](file:///home/slayer/.gemini/antigravity/brain/7af9d691-5c43-4eab-8a96-b83546283baa/documentation-plan.md)** - Docs structure, playground, and examples
