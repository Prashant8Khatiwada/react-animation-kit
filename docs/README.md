# Animation Library Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the animation library.

## Blueprint Documents

The `blueprint/` directory contains the complete architectural blueprint:

### Core Architecture
- **[architecture.md](blueprint/architecture.md)** - Build system, dependencies, tree-shaking, SSR safety, TypeScript configuration, and performance guidelines
- **[folder-structure.md](blueprint/folder-structure.md)** - Complete directory organization, file naming conventions, and scalability patterns

### Design & API
- **[api-patterns.md](blueprint/api-patterns.md)** - Component APIs, variant strategy, usage patterns, and TypeScript types
- **[design-guidelines.md](blueprint/design-guidelines.md)** - Animation identity, custom easing curves, motion principles, consistency rules, and accessibility guidelines

### Planning & Catalog
- **[animation-catalog.md](blueprint/animation-catalog.md)** - Complete catalog of 173 planned animations across 15 categories with descriptions
- **[implementation-plan.md](blueprint/implementation-plan.md)** - Master plan outlining the modular blueprint structure

### Distribution
- **[documentation-plan.md](blueprint/documentation-plan.md)** - Documentation website structure, playground features, versioning strategy, and release process

### Summary
- **[walkthrough.md](blueprint/walkthrough.md)** - Executive summary of the entire architectural blueprint and implementation status
- **[task.md](blueprint/task.md)** - Task tracking and progress checklist

## Using These Documents

These blueprints serve as the **source of truth** for:
- ✅ Design decisions and architectural choices
- ✅ Animation identity and consistency guidelines
- ✅ API patterns and component structure
- ✅ Scalability and maintenance strategies
- ✅ Future development roadmap

## Quick Links

### For Developers
- Start with [walkthrough.md](blueprint/walkthrough.md) for overview
- Reference [design-guidelines.md](blueprint/design-guidelines.md) when creating new animations
- Follow [api-patterns.md](blueprint/api-patterns.md) for component implementation

### For Contributors
- Check [animation-catalog.md](blueprint/animation-catalog.md) to see what's planned
- Follow [folder-structure.md](blueprint/folder-structure.md) for file organization
- Read [architecture.md](blueprint/architecture.md) for technical requirements

### For Documentation Writers
- Review [documentation-plan.md](blueprint/documentation-plan.md) for docs website structure
- Use [animation-catalog.md](blueprint/animation-catalog.md) as content source

## Future Documentation

Additional documentation will be added as the library grows:
- API reference (auto-generated from TypeScript)
- Usage guides and tutorials
- Example galleries
- Performance optimization guides
- Migration guides

**Note**: These blueprint documents were created during the initial architectural planning phase and represent the comprehensive design for a production-ready animation library with 173 planned animations.
